# Inscribe
Github profile name writer using batch script

Write your name on the contributions section in your Github profile with Inscribe

## How Inscribe works

It creates a test-repo to which a single commit is done. Initialising a README section would be enough. Then this commit is
amended and pushed at various dates depending on the letter given.

After the git is configured and a test-repo is generated, enter the no of letters and enter each letter. Once a letter is commited
, enter the next letter.

This project can be used by anyone who likes to maintain a contribution streak on Github.
